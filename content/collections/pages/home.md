## You need a consultant.

Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone on your team only focused on making your organization run better?

Most small nonprofits don’t have that luxury in their budget. However, a well-chosen, short term partnership can repair the big leaks and give you the tools for smooth sailing well into the future. Working with a consultant is an investment in your organization’s future—improve processes now so you can meet any challenge that comes your way.
