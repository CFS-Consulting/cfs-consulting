## You need a consultant.

Wouldn’t it be great if you had someone on your team only focused on making your organization run better? 

Most small nonprofits don’t have that luxury in their budget. However, a well-chosen, short term partnership can repair the big leaks and give you the tools for smooth sailing well into the future. Working with a consultant is an investment in your organization’s future—improve processes now so you can meet any challenge that comes your way.

My role is to research, reflect, and advise you on the problem at hand and also help you think about the implications of your practices for the future. While working together I may also create process documents, manuals, and other tools that you and your team can keep and adapt as you grow.
