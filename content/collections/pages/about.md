## Hi, I'm Caitlyn Ference-Saunders (she/hers).

With 15 years of nonprofit experience, I’ve helped donors make life-changing gifts, led administrative teams to success, and built sustainable systems that helped my teams achieve their professional goals and care for themselves. In addition to working in fundraising and operations, I've spent time as an event planner, curriculum designer, dialogue facilitator, and project manager. 

I bring all of that experience into my discussions with clients because I love troubleshooting to find contextual solutions to challenges. When you have an idea to birth or a problem to solve, let me know. I’ll be there to help.
