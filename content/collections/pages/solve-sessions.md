## Troubleshooting Support

Solve Sessions tackle a single problem, roadblock, or question that’s holding you or your team back. Think of it as *very* practical coaching. 

Solve sessions have addressed:
- How to get things done when the office admin quits without notice or notes.
- Stalled gala planning: how do I develop an event timeline asap?!
- Figuring out which position is the most necessary next hire: program or fundraising?

Solve Sessions **start at $110 per hour**.
