I have experience crafting impactful Mission, Vision, and Values statements, facilitating dynamic planning sessions, and writing strategic plans for 1, 3, and 5 years. I also provide budgeting expertise, assess program and fundraising income, and offer specialized training for board members on advocacy and engagement.
